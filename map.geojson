Platform 26 exploded and caught fire.  The platform included 22 production wells with a capacity of 15,000 barrels of crude oil per day.  The flames from the burning platform blazed 400 feet into the air.  The 21-B well, with a 424-barrel per day capacity, ruptured 12 feet above the water.  By December 3, the service crane had collapsed towards the center of the platform at a 60? angle.  Burning oil covered the surface of the water within 50 feet of the platform.  By December 7, well No. 21-B was contributing to 30-50 percent of the fire.  Shifting winds, fog and rough seas slowed response efforts at times.\u000bHoles were shot into the tubing of some of the wells to determine whether oil was still being produced.  On January 12, Shell Oil Co. personnel perforated a relief well in an attempt to contain the flow.  On January 20, eight of the wells remained on fire.  Corexit 7664 dispersant was applied to the slick at a rate of 3 barrels per hour.\u000bResponse operations began moderating on March 1.  A U.S. Coast Guard cutter and helicopter were released from the scene.  Shell Oil Co. officials were required to submit daily pollution reports to the U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the Port (COTP), New Orleans, in advance of any operations that may have increased pollution.  \u000bDrilling, capping, and pumping of the wells continued throughout April.  By April 16, the estimated rate of release was 20 barrels per day.  The slick was reportedly staying within a 6-mile radius of the platform, with sheen extending to 12 miles.  The slick was reduced to sheen during the following months as pumping and capping operations continued.\u000bBeach surveys were conducted by personnel from the U.S. Coast Guard, Shell Oil Co., the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries, and other local observers.  The only shoreline oiling that resulted from the incident was  between Caminada Pass and Bay Champagne.  The case was closed by the U.S. Coast Guard on May 17, 1971.  The explosion and subsequent fire killed four people and seriously burned 37 others.  USCG district 8.

The forward section of the barge began taking on water.  Due to darkness and heavy ice conditions, none of the 60,000 barrels of No. 6 oil aboard the Ethel H (II)  was observed to be leaking into the water at the time of the grounding.\u000bAt 0255 February 5, the dispatcher reported oil leaking from the #1 starboard tank on the Ethel H (II).  Oil was observed both north and south of the vessel, but did not reach the shore due to 12 to 20 inches of shorebound ice.  By 1015, the Ethel H (II)  had shifted partially off Con Hook Rock and was in danger of sinking.  Tugs assisted to help prevent the barge from sinking.  Sea Land Environmental Engineering Co, contracted by McAllister Towing Co., and the USCG Atlantic Strike Team (AST) arrived on-scene February 5.  After oil was pumped from submerged tanks, the barge's list was reduced to 15 degrees.  Once the barge was secured from sinking, Amerada Hess Corporation, owners of the Ethel H (II)  and McAllister Towing Co., refused responsibility for clean-up of any oil in the Hudson River.  The USCG took control of the cleanup, retaining Sea Land Environmental Engineering Company as the prime contractor.\u000bReports of oiled birds prompted the New York State Department of Conservation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to establish a primary bird cleaning center.  Several marinas and boat clubs on the Hudson reported oil impacts.  Extensive clean-up efforts continued through April 14, funded by the federal 3ll(k) oil pollution fund.  USCG district 1.

The cargo of catalytic cracker feedstock and Santa Maria crude oil spilled into the sea as the fire burned for ten hours.   Lightning apparently ignited accumulated cargo vapors on the deck of the vessel.  None of the cargo tanks had been gas-freed.  The explosion was so powerful that a 5 foot by 7 foot hull fragment from the burning vessel penetrated the roof of a Shell Oil Company petroleum product shore tank located 600 feet inland from the vessel.  The contents of that shore tank, approximately 26,000 barrels of ethyl alcohol, ignited and burned as well.  As the fire spread into a nearby barge slip, four barges that were discharging cargo caught fire.  Three of these barges exploded and sank.  No significant amount of pollution came from any of these four barges.  Weather during the incident was warm and windy with heavy downpours and lightning.  The maximum reported wind gust for the day was 33 knots, at 1300.\u000bThe fireboat M/V Captain F. L. Farnsworth, which had been moored 2.5 nautical miles from the terminal, was on-scene by 1430.  Four boats and 14 Coast Guard personnel assisted in fire fighting and lifesaving operations.  Two Coast Guard pollution team investigators from the Houston Port Safety Station were already on their way to the Shell terminal when the accident occurred.  They led the rescue of the burning vessel's boatswain from the forecastle.  Representatives from both the USCG Pacific and Gulf Strike Teams (PST and AST) monitored all phases of the cleanup.  Eighteen different cleanup companies were involved in the cleanup operations.  Since the spill occurred over a holiday weekend, it was difficult to recruit companies with equipment specifically needed for this spill.  \u000bOne crew member and two radar repairmen aboard the SS Chevron Hawaii  were killed and 13 people were injured.  Even though six tugs were available within the barge slip, no attempt was made by the Shell Oil Company dockman or the tugboat operators to move any adjacent barges into the channel where they might have been safe from the fire.  Also, the dockman left the scene without activating the emergency cut-off switch.  This would have assured that any adjacent barges' cargo openings were properly secured.  Damages to the vessel, barges and facility exceeded $27,000,000.  USCG district 8.

The water depth at the wellhead site is about 50 m (164 feet). The IXTOC I was being drilled by the SEDCO 135, a semi-submersible platform on lease to Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX). A loss of drilling mud circulation caused the blowout to occur. The oil and gas blowing out of the well ignited, causing the platform to catch fire. The burning platform collapsed into the wellhead area hindering any immediate attempts to control the blowout. PEMEX hired blowout control experts and other spill control experts including Red Adair, Martech International of Houston, and the Mexican diving company, Daivaz. The Martech response included 50 personnel on site, the remotely operated vehicle TREC, and the submersible Pioneer I. The TREC attempted to find a safe approach to the Blowout Preventer (BOP). The approach was complicated by poor visibility and debris on the seafloor including derrick wreckage and 3000 meters of drilling pipe. Divers were eventually able to reach and activate the BOP, but the pressure of the oil and gas caused the valves to begin rupturing. The BOP was reopened to prevent destroying it. Two relief wells were drilled to relieve pressure from the well to allow response personnel to cap it. Norwegian experts were contracted to bring in skimming equipment and containment booms, and to begin cleanup of the spilled oil.

The vessel initially spilled about 950 barrels of light oil and continued to leak for the duration of the incident.  An initial survey found nine of 12 tanks holed.  The ship's refrigeration system failed, releasing toxic levels of ammonia gas in the interior.   Access to the vessel was complicated by the rough seas and a 200-foot high cliff at the grounding site.  A makeshift, 90-foot highline was rigged from the base of the cliff to the ship.  The only alternative mode of access was by helicopter, which was not always available because of weather.\u000bThe Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Office (MSO), Anchorage, the predesignated On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) for the spill, sent a representative to the site on November 9.  The owners of the vessel initially assumed responsibility for cleanup operations, but abandoned their responsibility on November 15, at which time the OSC took full control of the spill response.  Explosives were used to vent dangerous accumulations of ammonia gas on November 20, and also to finally destroy the vessel on November 22.  The response ended on December 5.  USCG district 17.

Weather at the time was cloudy and overcast with light rain.  Visibility was 8 miles with winds gusting from the northwest to 25 miles per hour.  Crew error was the primary cause of the accident.  The barges, V882, V883, V884, and V885, were laden with a total of approximately 65,003 barrels of Montana Mix sour crude oil.  One of the barges exploded on impact and burst into flames.  As the fire continued to spread, the tow broke, setting three of the burning barges adrift down the river.  The tug and attached barge V885 were moved to the Peabody Coal facility at mile 179.2 for lightering and inspection.\u000bThe three drifting barges caused extensive damage to facilities and other barges along the left descending bank on the Illinois side of the river.  While traveling downriver, one of the barges struck the Pillsbury Grain dock facility.  The fire spread to the dock, the grain elevator, and trees and bushes on the shoreline.  Three grain barges nearby caught fire as well.  A coal barge on the Missouri side of the river ignited from contact with one of the barges.  The Monsanto dock caught fire after being struck by one of the barges, and the impact ruptured a pipeline on a walkway, releasing approximately 100 pounds of monochlorobenzene into the river.\u000bBarge V884 suffered the most damage, both the barge and its discharged cargo on the river's surface were in flames.  After drifting downstream, V884 sank at mile 178.2 Upper Mississippi River (UMR) near the Cahokia Power Plant.  The barge continued to release its total cargo of 10,882 barrels of crude oil.  While burning out of control, barge V883 lodged bow first into the bank above the Cahokia Power Plant.  The fire spread uncontrollably onto the shore.  An hour later, V883 broke loose and continued drifting down the river, still engulfed in flames.  The M/V Katie  eventually grounded V883 by pushing it into the bank at the Pillsbury Facility.  The leading barge, V882, was forced into the Arsenal Island barge fleet area after being controlled by the M/V Gary D. Partridge.  \u000bThe USCG Cutters Obion  and Cheyenne  fought the fire on V883 as well as the fire at the Phillips facility.  The cutters used all but two of their fire fighting foam cans.  To reduce the probability of reflash, the Cheyenne  applied a low-velocity water fog to V883.  The M/V Tom McConnel  used her propwash to keep burning oil on the water from reaching the Cheyenne  during firefighting operations.  By 1330 on April 3, the fires on the three escaped barges, the three grain barges, and the Pillsbury dock were out.  \u000bValley Towing Service, Inc., the owners of the tug and barges, assumed financial responsibility for the cleanup.

Dan Cargill, Mso Seattle From: Bob Pavia, NOAA SSC Subj: Bremerton Navy Spill  Winds for the region are forecast as light and variable through tonight. Tomorrow winds will again be light, 5-15kts, with a generally southerly direction. Oil landfall is difficult to predict and is very dependent on what the wind does tomorrow. The oil in Dyes and Sinclair Inlet will tend to mill around with no dominate direction. Oil near rich Passage will be drawn into the Sound on the ebb tide. the next ebb will peak at about 1800. Oil in Port Orchard will tend to move north if the winds are as predicted. In general the threat area can be taken as Port Orchard to Waterman Pt., the north side of Rich Passage, the west side of Bainbridge Island, and the northern end of Dyes Inlet. It is not possible to pridict how oil leaving Rich Passage on an ebb will move  in the Sound. Clam Bay is at some risk.  Sensitive Environmental Resources There are a number of very sensitive sheltered tidal flats and marshes(ESI 9-10) in Sinclair and Dyes Inlets. Subject to the trajectory information above, these should be a high priority for protection.  Sinclair INlet southwest end Dyes Inlet Silverdale Madrona Pt. Mud Bay Phinney Bay Chico Bay  There are a wide variety of shore, wading, and diving birds and waterfowl in the Inlets, Port Orchard, and especially Clam Bay. River Otter are found at the southwest end of Sinclair. Numerous streams in the area support salmon. Juvenile migration of coho and chum should be taking place. There are two mariculture facilities, one at Beans Pt, and one at Clam Bay on Rich Passage, which should be notified of the spill.  Movement of the slicks and wind direction should be watched closely tomorrow. Protective booming should be considered in sensitive areas if impacts seem likely.

Apparently, a blowout preventer (BOP) valve malfunction caused the initial blowout.  Although the BOP had successfully shut the annulus between the drill pipe and well casing, the blind rams failed to shear through the drill pipe that was still in the well casing.  Therefore, oil and gas flowed out of the well, up the drill pipe, and onto the platform where it ignited.  The oil discharge increased after the escaping gas and oil forced the drill pipe out of the well.  The initial fire was extinguished by October 17.  As of October 28, the well was still spewing out a yellow gas/crude mix  60-100 feet in the air.  The owners of the well, Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), and the Mexican Navy participated in cleanup operations.  The well was finally \"killed\" on November 30.  \u000bEven though the incident site was 600 miles from Texas, the slick could have traveled in a northerly direction to reach United States waters depending on the duration of the spill.  Accordingly, the USCG Marine Safety Office (MSO) at Corpus Christi, Texas, was notified of the incident on October 13.  Verification and correct information were not received until October 16.  Even though USCG assistance was refused, the USCG conducted overflights of the area every other day until the well was capped to track the spill response and the movement of the oil.  Reports of cleanup activities from the Mexican authorities were infrequent and largely erroneous.

NOAA advised that potential health and/or environmental impacts should be reported to local and state health officials and to state environmental officials.  Mr. Winkler reported that he had made a number of these reports to State and County officials but was not satisfied with their response.  After the first call, NOAA looked at the thermal images of the Gulf Stream and discussed with Mr. Winkler that Gulf Steam waters or material dumped in New York City would not be in direct contact with Bethany Bay beaches.  NOAA also contacted marine laboratories and phytoplankton experts at the University of Delaware, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Laboratories at Mountlake, WA, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, and the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.  The names and contact numbers for phytoplankton experts at these institutions were provided to Mr. Winkler.   NOAA coordinated with the State of Delaware's environmental officials on each of the \"red tide\" reports that we received and with our efforts in contacting expert laboratories to determine the results of Mr. Winkler's samples.  On September 15th the Delaware's Director of Water Resources wrote a 4-page letter to Mr. Winkler listing the considerable efforts of the State of Delaware's Department of Water Resources to investigate each of Mr. Winkler's reports.  Delaware's letter noted that samples analyzed by DNREC \"reveal no Pfieseria, no significant water chemistry findings, and no presence of organisms in bloom-like conditions\" and that the \"water samples collected by you (Mr. Winkler) and DNREC that have been analyzed by the Florida Marine Research Institute and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute have revealed no harmful species, no toxic dinoflagellate species, and no red tide cell concentrations.\" On September 22ed the NOAA SSC discussed Mr. Winkler's reports with the Chief of the Bethany Beach Fire Company and a member of the Bethany Beach Town Council.  Both the Fire Chief and the member of the Town Council reported that there were no unusual health impact reports from swimmers using the city's beaches.    On September 29th the laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington reported to DNREC that they were able to detect numbers of plankton specie named \"Chattonella verruculosa\" in the samples of water that were provided to them by Mr. Winkler.   This plankton had previously been reported in waters as far north as North Carolina, but experts at the University of North Carolina reported that it was unusual for this species to be as far north as Delaware.  This plankton did produce a brevetoxin  On October 12th the State of Delaware organized a seminar to discuss the complexity of the algal booms and their potential toxicity in Mid Atlantic Ocean waters.  As a result of Delaware's efforts, scientists from Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina are sharing information on the algal booms reported off their coasts.  It seems clear to these scientists that much of the \"reds stuff in the water\" sightings reported during the summer of 2000 were algal booms.  The scientists reported that it is not unusual for these blooms to drift with the currents and appear or disappear from one day to the next (or even hour to hour.)  The \"disappearing\" of the bloom is likely due to wind and other weather conditions.  For example, when it is windy, the bloom, that is often concentrated near the surface, can be mixed down several feet and thus become almost invisible.  If the wind subsides and the sun conditions are right, these organisms can float or swim back to the surface and again become much more visible.

Dimethoate is a sulfur-containing compound with a mercaptin-like odor.  Its high molecular weight and low vapor pressure makes it quite stable in solid form at ambient temperatures, and its odor is noticeable even in extremely low concentrations.  NOAA hypothesized that some vapor from the solid dimethoate may have leaked into the closed container during shipment, and that it was this vapor that was detected while the vessel was en route to San Francisco.  The concentration in the atmosphere within the container was probably never at a toxic level even though it would have been uncomfortable to breathe.  Once the container was opened and exposed to circulating air, the detectable odor would dissipate rapidly.    NOAA recommended that personnel involved in the inspection of the shipping container be suited in Level B protection as a conservative measure as dimethoate does not present a significant inhalation hazard when shipped in solid form.  The primary concern with this product was to avoid inhalation or ingestion of airborne dust from a potentially damaged shipping container and to restrict dermal contact to minimize any chance of skin absorption.  A visual inspection of the container by the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office found no evidence of damage to the container or spillage of dimethoate.  Accordingly, the container was left aboard the vessel for continuation to the WAARDRECHT's destination in Mexico.   The case was closed after the container was inspected and found to be undamaged.

After the initial on-site inspections, MSO Hampton Roads maintained a staff at the island's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) with other federal, state and local emergency response personnel for two weeks.\u000bThe USCG surveyed the entire coast of Hatteras Island by helicopter and land-based Pollution Response teams (PRTs).  There was very little oil spilled; eight spills were reported and only three of these required cleanup.  By September 3 cleanup at Oden's Marina and the restaurant had been completed and the removal of oil from the damaged Texaco tanks was underway.  About 2,500 gallons of oil were collected and removed.\u000bThe emergency response activities from Hurricane Emily on Hatteras Island consumed the attention and resources of most of the emergency response staff and the island's residents.  The actual oil cleanup was handled by the USCG and their contractor International Marine Services.  USCG district 5.

BERMAN","location":"San Juan, Puerto Rico","threat":"","commodity":"# 6 fuel oil","maxPtlReleaseGallons":"","field_10":130,"description":"On January 7, 1994, the barge Morris J. Berman went aground in the surf zone off Escambron Beach in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  The barge grounded on a hard bottom consisting of rocky substrate with scattered coral after its towing cable parted.\u000b\u000bThe barge had a capacity of three million gallons but was reportedly only half full.  The cargo, a heavy #6 fuel oil, began spilling and impacted nearby shoreline and shallow intertidal habitats immediately.  No estimated leakage rate was available.  Due to strong northerly winds, the surf at the grounding site was quite strong creating a hazardous situation as they pounded the deck of the vessel. \u000b\u000bThe responsible party initially assumed responsibility for the spill, but very quickly expended the ten million dollar limit of their insurance policy.  Full federal funding of the spill occurred at 0600 on January 14 and it became a United States Coast Guard (USCG) directed response.\u000b\u000bThe USCG Gulf Strike Team (GST) was brought onscene and immediately began lightering operations for the barge.  Skimming and lightering operations were effective and removed an estimated 17,700 barrels of oil from the water and leaking barge.  Shoreline cleanup and assessment began almost immediately.  Little progress was made however due to continued leaking of fresh oil from the barge.  Cleaned areas became re-oiled and areas not yet cleaned became more heavily impacted.  Protection strategies were employed for areas at risk that were not yet oiled.  Intensive shoreline cleanup was postponed for the most heavily impacted areas until the sources of re-oiling could be stopped.  Two shallow lagoons near the grounding site were most heavily impacted.  Oil, in the form of large mats, accumulated on the surface and on the bottom of the lagoons.  Submerged oil posed a major cleanup problem during the response.  It was eventually partially removed by divers, vacuum transfer units, and a dredge.  Waste and oily water from dredging operations were collected and separated in a series of swimming pools arranged to decant and filter the effluent from the dredge before returning the filtered water to the sea. \u000b\u000bOn January 15, the barge was refloated, towed to a scuttling site 20 miles northeast of San Juan, and sunk.  This operation was carefully reviewed by the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC), Navy Superintendent of Salvage (SUPSALV), the GST, and NOAA.  The Regional Response Team (RRT) was consulted and on-scene trustee representatives were given an opportunity to discuss the operation and voice their concerns.  It was agreed by all that the sinking of the barge was the best alternative.  Continued re-oiling of the nearshore environment from the unrecoverable oil left onboard was delaying cleanup and preventing resource recovery.  Resource concerns offshore were minimal and it was hoped that the amount of residual oil left on the barge when it sank would be small and have little impact.  Shorelines at risk from any oil released during the scuttling operations were predicted to be on northwestern Puerto Rico, Mona Island, and Hispaniola.\u000b\u000bShoreline cleaning continued in earnest and was more successful with the barge removed.  Surface and buried oil along sand beaches was removed following cleanup guidelines.  Beachrock, riprap, and seawalls were cleaned with pressure washing and chemical cleaners as approved.  Some inaccessible areas were left to clean naturally.  Cleanup guidelines for oiled historical structures were developed and approved by trustees through the Heritage Resource Team.  These structures and resources were then cleaned according to those guidelines.\u000b\u000bOn February 3, oil impacts along northwestern Puerto Rico were reported.  A convergence zone at the northwest corner of the island concentrated debris and oil still being released from the scuttled barge.  Impacts were primarily along 12 miles of shoreline, from Isabella to Borinquen.  This oil was buried as oily sand layers and submerged as oil and sand mats in the protected areas or crenulate bays.  A separate command post was established on the west end of the island and assessments and cleanup operations began immediately.  Crews removed the stranded oil quickly to prevent additional burial.  Cleanup efforts were intensified in this area to minimize risks to nesting sea turtles, whose arrival was imminent. \u000b\u000bAll necessary cleanup guidelines and inspection criteria were in place by mid-February.  With the exception of nearshore reef fish and benthic organisms near the barge's grounding site, there were very few impacts to biological resources.   Seagrasses were oiled near the grounding site.  Very few birds were affected and no substantiated reports of spill related mortalities to reptiles or mammals were received.  The impacted shoreline was divided into 18 shoreline segments or zones.  Most of these zones were cleaned and inspected following the \"how clean is clean\" guidelines, and approved by the FOSC by April 4.  All other zones were signed off by April 25, with the exception of zone 18, which was completed on May 27.  Once approved as clean, each zone entered a monitoring and maintenance phase to address any additional oiling that may occur.  USCG district 7.

Heavy surf and high winds throughout the next several days made boarding the vessel difficult and dangerous. While the preferred option was to salvage the vessel with the oil on board, the Unified Command requested that contingency plans for vessel lightering, cleanup and pollution response be developed. The longer the ship remained grounded, the greater the risk of it leaking its load of nearly 400,000 gallons of fuel oil. Moreover, a small group of endangered snowy plover was located approximately 800 yards south of the vessel.  In fact, on February 8, shipboard personnel observed oil burping out alongside the ship from a small crack in the hull and on the beach near the ship.  On February 9, a tug tried to pull the ship off the beach. But by then winds and waves had driven the New Carissa approximately 600 feet further shoreward, beyond the operational reach of the salvage vessel and its ability to safely anchor near the surf zone. The bow section was towed and sunk on March 11, 1999 in 1,811 fathoms of water 282 nautical miles off the Oregon coast.  58 Federal, state, county, and local agencies took part in the month-long response.

The spilled oil was a condensate crude with an API of 38.  The stretch of shoreline from Galveston to Freeport is historically an area with high concentrations of birds.  In particular, the area around San Luis Pass is an important feeding and loafing area for shorebirds, gulls, terns, loons, pelicans, and wading birds.  At the time of the spill, because of the very early spring weather, many birds were staging along the beaches, particularly shorebirds who are feeding to bulk up for the migration to nesting areas.  Though shorebirds have a lower tendency to get oiled (compared to diving birds who spend much of their time on the water surface or diving for prey) they spend a lot of time feeding at the water/land interface where any tarballs that come ashore are likely to concentrate.  With onshore winds, the ultimate fate of any persistent oil was shoreline stranding.  Normally, tarballs on shore are not an issue because they are easy to clean up.  However, because of the high concentrations of birds present in the area of the predicted impact, there was a risk of birds getting oiled.  USCG district 8.

The fore fish hold was filled with diesel fuel, which although not a violation, was an extremely sloppy maritime practice.  The vessel was rusty, cramped, full of junk, and her systems were just barely in working order.  While in port, a serious ammonia leak occurred driving the crew out of the lower levels.  As a result of this chemical incident the USCG called in the Pacific Strike Team (PST).  The PST sent seven members on-scene and, outfitted in level B protective gear, began monitoring the levels of ammonia in the ship.   In several locations concentrations of several hundred ppm were measured, and since the IDLH for ammonia is 300 ppm, it was deemed a very serious situation. Not knowing how much ammonia was onboard, the PST decided to bleed off the system.  On the fourth level down in the ship, a 55-gallon drum of water and fans were set up to bleed the ammonia into.

On-scene conditions were 55-knot winds, 30-foot seas, snow, icing conditions, and 1/4 nm visibility.  The quantity of logs was quite large-200 to 400 log bundles of 80 to 100 logs per bundle.  The logs were 41 to 45 feet long and 4 to 15 inches in diameter; each bundle weighed approximate 27 tons.  The USCG deemed these logs a hazard to navigation of TAPS tankers, container vessels, and maritime traffic in the GOA.  Initially the logs were in MSO Juneau's zone and, along with the Seventeenth District Coast Guard Operations Center in Juneau, requested that NOAA provide weather forecasts and predict trajectories of the logs to monitor the position of the logs help their C-130 overflights.  NOAA's initial report to the USCG was that the trajectory of the logs will continue west-southwest at 2% of the wind speed (0.5 knots) until they cross the 100-fathom curve where they will encounter the Alaska Current and begin moving in a west-northwest direction at approximately the same speed.\u000bDue to the severe weather, many of the log bundles broke apart making it very difficult for ships' radar to see this debris.  The weather was not cooperative and overflights could be conducted only every 3 to 5 days.  As location reports came in, they were forwarded to NOAA in Seattle who then used this information to provide a search location for the next overflight.  The Alaska Stream occupies this portion of the GOA and moves from east to west and the logs were gradually dispersed and carried west-northwest toward the central GOA.  As the logs moved west, MSO Valdez became involved in the tracking effort and served to coordinate information flowing to and from USCG Kodiak Air Station who was conducting the overflights.

The Good Sam vessel arrived on-scene and reported that the Poseidon's nets were in the water, the running lights were energized, the generator was running, but there were no crew members visible on deck.  The Good Sam vessel was thanked for her help and released because the unknown situation could be dangerous. A USCG Station Panama City UTB was launched and directed to investigate the situation.  The UTB arrived on-scene, dispatched a boarding team to the vessel, and discovered three crewmembers lying in the hold apparently deceased.

With rocky shores to roughly one mile either side, the vessel grounded in the afternoon on a sand and gravel beach.  The steel hull remained intact, and no pollution was observed.  Then began a month long dance with the weather as the salvor, Dan Magone from Dutch Harbor, tried several times to reach the vessel only to be thwarted by the weather and  high seas.  Finally large bladders were flown in by the Coast Guard, and the salvor successfully pumped the fuel and removed the drums from the vessel, with no pollution to the environment.

It was reported as scattered tarballs along a 10 -- 12 mile stretch of the NJ ocean beaches from Manisquan Inlet to Seaside Heights. The SSC recommended that overflights and SCAT patrols look on the inside of the coastal inlets, as oil might have migrated inside the bay areas on incoming flood tides. Cleanup recommendations and bird recovery and rehabilitation strategies were also discussed. The NOAA Damage Assessment Coordinator was also notified. The NMFS noted that a number of seals (Harbor, harp, hooded, and grey) may be in the area. So far there have been about 20 birds affected (both dead and for rehab). Species include cormorants, ganets, seagulls, and red-throated loons. Manual cleanup operations were underway. With the impending storm cleanup efforts were focused on removal of the gross oil (larger tarballs and patties). Assessments after the storm passes were made to determine the need for further cleanup. There has been no identified source of the oil. The USCG Districts 1 and 5 have passed the word to all units to be on the lookout for any suspect vessels. Samples of the tarballs have been sent to the USCG Oil Identification Lab in Groton, CT for fingerprinting. The SSC brought up the point that the source may also be one of the many sunken tankers off the coast. USCG aircraft expanded their search further offshore in an attempt to spot any subsurface sources. There had been fairly high local media interest both in the New York and Philadelphia areas as well as from local NJ community press. NOAA trajectory modelers investigated the possibility of performing a hindcast to determine where the source of the oil may have likely originated. This was difficult and depend on the ability of the NWS to provide accurate local weather data for the last 10 days, as well as good current data."},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.0069,40.1993]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":1047,"openDate":"05/03/2003","name":"F/V Angel Dawn Aground","location":"Oregon Inlet, NC","threat":"Oil","commodity":"diesel fuel","maxPtlReleaseGallons":3200,"field_10":"","description":""},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.5167,35.7027]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":1086,"openDate":"05/08/2003","name":"Willamette River Diesel Spill","location":"Portland, OR","threat":"Oil","commodity":"Diesel","maxPtlReleaseGallons":1500,"field_10":"","description":""},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122.773,45.651]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":1103,"openDate":"06/10/2003","name":"M/V Presque Isle","location":"Lake Superior near Eagle Harbor, MI","threat":"Oil","commodity":"IFO-310","maxPtlReleaseGallons":800,"field_10":"","description":""},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-90.2047,47.2736]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":1037,"openDate":"07/01/2003","name":"East Breaks Block 160","location":"Gulf of Mexico","threat":"Oil","commodity":"light crude oil","maxPtlReleaseGallons":630,"field_10":"","description":""},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-94.55,27.833]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":1076,"openDate":"07/06/2003","name":"Bouchard Barge 160","location":"Long Island Sound, NY","threat":"Oil","commodity":"# 6 oil","maxPtlReleaseGallons":110000,"field_10":"","description":""},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-72.6499,40.992]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":1085,"openDate":"07/08/2003","name":"F/V Chichagof Grounded","location":"Kodiak Island, AK","threat":"Oil","commodity":"Diesel","maxPtlReleaseGallons":15000,"field_10":"","description":""},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-155.223,55.8933]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":1102,"openDate":"07/09/2003","name":"Tug Victoria Hunt Rose","location":"Nahant, MA","threat":"Oil","commodity":"Diesel and lube oil","maxPtlReleaseGallons":8080,"field_10":"","description":""},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-70.8765,42.4368]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"id":1112,"openDate":"07/11/2003","name":"Well Fire","location":"Louisiana Bayou, LA","threat":"Oil","commodity":"Crude oil","maxPtlReleaseGallons":"","field_10":1,"description":"A well in Louisiana had a blowout and a fire.

The overpack was not relocated in order to minimize potential cross contamination.\u000b\u000bEPA and its START and ERRS contractors returned to the Site on July 3, 2012 to conduct an emergency removal action. The contaminated dock area was cleaned to prevent further contamination of the residential property, the gross mercury contamination was removed from the lakebed, the area where the flasks were found was poled to determine if additional containers remain buried in the area, and the mercury waste was removed from the Site. Sediment samples were collected to assess the impact of the spill on the lakebed and determine the need and extent of additional removal activities. USCG and the WUPHD representatives were on-scene during the July 3, 2012 removal activities. MDEQ returned to the Site after EPA, USCG, and WUPHD had demobilized to collect surface water samples.\u000b\u000bEPA is planning to remobilize to the Site the week of July 9, 2012 to establish an exclusionary zone around the impacted area and conduct a comprehensive site assessment of the spill area.

Given the forecast on an approaching winter frontal passage and the distance off-shore (25 plus miles), no landfall of oil was forecast for the next several days.

Evidently the hole was below the product level and some product was lost to the hopper.  Again, the quaintly is currently unknown.\u000b-The Unified Command is currently in a planning meeting.  The reported plan is:-1.  Clean up the bottom of the hopper.  Two options to be accomplished this are by either pumping or siphoning the product from the deck and flushing the deck with river water.  The specific course of action has not yet been finalized.-2.  Temporally patch the hole in the tank to avoid further loss of product during transit and.-3.

A NOAA technical support team reported on-scene to assist the SSC.\u000bThe NOAA support team surveyed the site and collected five water column samples and five shoreline samples for analysis.\u000bNOAA reported that there are many species of birds, fish, snakes, and mammals in the area, as well as alligators.  NOAA recommended that the spartina not be cut.\u000bThe SSC told the FOSC that the pollutants should not spread rapidly because of the location of the barges, the shape of the cut, and the fact that the wind is the primary influence over the localized currents.   NOAA recommended using a bubble curtain if a water-soluble product was released into the water column.  NOAA suggested containing all the product within the far end of the canal in which the barges were located. In addition, four paddle-wheel aerators should be placed diagonally across from each other to generate a circular current within the containment area.  NOAA also recommended damming the cut where the barges were located.  If polychlorinated biphenyls or Aroclor were onboard the barges, as suspected, removing sediments could be necessary in the event of a major release.\u000bThere probably was a spill of around 300 gallons from the Z-62 barge.   According to chemistry analyses from the site, there were at least three different types of oils in the sediment.  The water column was clean.  Samples of the barge's product are being analyzed.  It will not be possible to determine the extent of the spill on the area until the analyses of these samples are completed and compared to the sediment samples.\u000bThe disposal of these barges is an ongoing effort and has been halted due to a lack of funds.  Efforts are being made to acquire funding through the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act.

Fearful of capsizing, the captain put out a MAYDAY and\u000ball five crewmen were lifted from the vessel by a Coast Guard\u000bhelicopter.   Northeasterly winds caused the unmanned crabbing to drift\u000bparallel to the coast until the afternoon of Oct. 16 when it was in a\u000bposition 12 to 15 miles due north of Amak Island.  With winds shifting\u000bto the north the Coast Guard became very concerned that it might ground\u000bon Amak Island, the site of a sea lion haulout, classified as an\u000bendangered species.   At this point the Coast Guard asked NOAA to get\u000binvolved and provide a \"most likely\" trajectory for the vessel.   NOAA's\u000btrajectory had the F/V Raven just missing the east side of the island\u000band grounding on the barrier islands outside of Izembek Lagoon, a\u000bNational Wildlife Refuge being very sensitive with its large number of\u000btransient waterfowl waiting to migrate southward.   The CGC Morgenthau\u000bwas on scene shadowing the Raven but was unable to attach a towline due\u000bto the heavy seas.   Instead, it attached a drogue, which slowed the\u000bmovement of the vessel.  Meanwhile the owner hired Dan Magone from\u000bUnalaska to attempt to come to the scene and offer assistance.

Oil is leaking at a low rate into a drainage ditch and then into the Cape Fear River. The responsible party has also terminated maintenance of a recovery well located about five feet from the edge of the drainage ditch.  Pumps had been used to remove floating oil from the well while depressing the local ground water level .  This had prevented oil from leaching into the drainage ditch. The facility has approximately 15-20 tanks with concrete bottoms. Some sludges in 55 gallon drums have been observed on the site. Oil contamination of soils and potential contamination of underground waters has been estimated as high as 100,000 gallons. (the methods used for this estimate are not known).

The damage was attributed to a fracture initiated by a weld defect and aggravated by wave impacts on the bow at low temperatures.  Although the tanker remained intact for some time after the initial hull plate failure, the bow and stern sections eventually separated and spilled an estimated 43,900 barrels of Bunker C into Cabot Strait.  The bow and stern sections drifted towards Canadian waters.  Approximately 50,000 barrels of oil remained in the bow section while 115,000 barrels remained in the stern.\u000bA wide band of mobile pack ice initially prevented the spilled oil from reaching the shoreline.  The Environmental Protection Service (EPS) immediately initiated the formation of the Regional Environmental Emergencies Team (REET) to provide assistance and advice to the Canadian Coast Guard's (CCG) On-Scene Commander (OSC).  REET members included the Atmospheric Environment Service, Bedford Institute of Oceanography, and Fisheries Management Service.  The REET was divided into three sections to deal with the three distinct problems: the bow, the stern, and the oil spill cleanup.  Under Lloyds Open Forum, the stern section was towed to Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia, to recover remaining oil.  The bow section was towed to a deep water area 200 nautical miles off Nova Scotia and sunk by gunfire from the HMCS Margaree  on April 1, 1979.  Oil started coming ashore in April and two cleanup control centers were established at Low Point and Mulgrave, Nova Scotia.

It is possible that the release was gradual over the course of weeks or months until the material released reached a level that caused a visible reaction in the waters of the barge canal.  The spill site is actually two water bodies; an industrial barge canal in Bienville Industrial Park and a freshwater riverine/marsh habitat in the adjacent Mulatto Bayou.  Mulatto Bayou runs somewhat parallel to the barge canal with several bank cuts allowing water interchange between the two.\u000b\u000bHopper barges RL-224 and RL-229 had been alongside the industrial park at the dead end of the barge canal for several weeks and several months, respectively.  Their cargo of dry ferrous sulfate was destined for Eaglebrook Inc. but was rejected because it was out of specification for their needs.  Ferrous sulfate is reacted in a controlled situation by Eaglebrook to make a flocculating agent used in wastewater treatment.  As the barges waited at the industrial park pending final disposition, it is believed that water entered the barges through holes in their wing tanks and then, through free communication with the hoppers themselves, made contact with the cargo.  During the response the contaminated water in the hoppers was found to have a pH of approximately 2.0.  The contaminated water in the wing tanks was found to have a pH of approximately 3.0.

A wake from a passing bulk carrier apparently caused the parting of the Jupiter's  transfer hose, grounding cable, and all but one of its mooring lines.  Residual gasoline in the broken transfer hose was believed to have been ignited by a spark on the dock.  The Jupiter's  stern swung around into the Saginaw River and grounded perpendicular to the direction of the river flow.  The grounding resulted in a crack in the vessel's hull from the manifold on the starboard side to 75 feet aft of the manifold on the port side.\u000bArea marinas were evacuated and vessel traffic was halted.  Bangor County Fire Department and USCG personnel arrived on-scene within 30 minutes of the incident.  The pier fire was extinguished in an attempt to save the last mooring line while the fire onboard the vessel remained out of control.  Williams Boots & Coots Company (WB&C) from Houston, Texas, was contracted to fight the fire due to the lack of locally available trained personnel and equipment.  At 1315 on September 17, WB&C personnel extinguished the blaze by applying foam.  Carbon black accumulations falling from the overhead re-ignited the fire at 2300.  This second blaze was cooled with water and extinguished with foam on September 18.  WB&C personnel also applied foam inside the vessel's cargo tanks to prevent re-ignition of the vessel.\u000bRiver flow data were obtained from the Army Corps of Engineers to predict the oil movement.  Shock waves from the explosion may have contributed to the deaths of several fish that were recovered from around the vessel.

The creek bank was found to be saturated with oil which was leaching into the creek.  Fifty feet directly up the creek bank on Plabell property were fill pipes for two 1000 gallon underground storage tanks used by the company.  The tanks contained a \"chemically neutralized heavy napthenic distillate,\" product name CIRCO LIGHT RPO (Sun Refining and Marketing).\u000bOil samples were taken from the tanks, water, and soil, and sent to the City of Toledo Environmental Services Agency and the Coast Guard Central Oil Identification Laboratory (COIL) in Groton, Connecticut, for analysis.  The Coast Guard MSO, Toledo, also deployed a sorbent boom to contain the oil.\u000bResults of the COIL lab testing indicated that samples from the tanks and water were very similar, but contained differences that could not be attributed to weathering or contamination alone.

The San Jacinto River rose from its normal height of 2.5 feet to 24.3 feet.  The river overtopped its banks, cutoff a meandering loop, and scoured a new channel through a normally dry area containing pipelines.  As a result of the flooding, Houston had been declared a National Disaster Area and the estuarine environments of Galveston Bay were stressed because of the influx of fresh floodwaters.   As the flood waters began to recede, pipelines began to rupture.\u000bIt was surmised that large debris or some barges had broken free and were caught in the high-river currents and collided with the pipelines, causing four of them to rupture.

NOAA was also asked to advise on the environmental resources-at-risk if the vessel was allowed to sink.     The NOAA Scientific Support Coordinator advised the Coast Guard that sinking the vessel could produce two scenario extremes.  The most likely scenario would be a small, continuous leak from the tank's vent pipes.  However, a catastrophic release of the entire fuel tank could occur any time during or after the sinking of the vessel.  Since the vessel was subject to the Tongass Narrows currents,  the visible extent of the slick and sheen could range from a few meters in length to a few thousand meters, respectively.      NOAA suggested that the Coast Guard check the water depth at the pier because a partial sinking could result in a tidally induced pumping action which would cause a much greater rate of outflow of diesel fuel.    Consultation with resource agencies revealed large populations of herring and chinook salmon, and thousands of seabirds, including 50 bald eagles, in the vessel's immediate vicinity.

The sheening was first observed on October 11, 2007, and is currently only sheening minimally.  Nevertheless, Sector Anchorage has established an IC here in Anchorage to deal with the pollution.   Current plans are to get the PST, along with state and contract folks, to conduct an evaluation and appraisal of the situation probably beginning around the first of next week.   The sheening site is adjacent to a FUDS site in which the Army Corp of Engineers removed 2000 old drums containing only 100+ gallons of mixed petroleum fluids.  In addition to old military drums, the dump site has been used by locals for years and contains derelict fishing gear, batteries, old vehicles, some medical waste and on and on.  As a result, this response is being funded by CERCLA.  NOAA has asked the NWS to provide a weeks' worth of Spot forecasts beginning November 23 and is currently providing tidal data for the incident.   The Coast Guard assessed the situation, Nov. 28, when a six-man team consisting of Coast Guard, state of Alaska, and contractor reps flew to Port Heiden.     Their first impression was how much had changed at the dump site from the photos taken only one month previous.  No sheens or evidence of on-going releases was observed.   Numerous old fuel drums were in the intertidal zone, all seriously rusted and open to the environment.  In one and one-half months time, the shoreline embankment had eroded back from 10 to 40 feet.   As a result, both the FOSC and the SOSC agreed to close the case.  They asked the locals to continue monitoring the beach/dump site, and to remove any old batteries or minor amounts of oily fluids in drums that might appear.    Case Closed.

The MSO hired cleanup contractors for this federally funded cleanup; the facility owner refused to take responsibility.   Contractors placed boom in the water and began steam cleaning bulkheads, riprap, and pilings.  Oil-soaked soil leaking through a bulkhead proved to be the source of the slick.\u000bFound on the site were twenty-three tanks containing unknown product and sludge, three unmarked drums, bags of asbestos waste, hundreds of bales of shredded paper and other garbage, and two five-inch artillery shells.  Two tanks were unstable and many were without tops or had holes cut in them. The USCG contacted the Philadelphia Bomb Squad to remove the artillery shells and was contacted by the Philadelphia Environmental Crimes Unit concerning other possible legal infractions at the site.

The Chief Engineer on board the Pac Baroness activated the vessel's bilge pumps and a tug attached a towline to the vessel to prevent the Pac Baroness from drifting toward the shoreline.  By 1607, the Pac Baroness was still  taking on water and was  close to sinking.  The Pac Baroness sank at 1618 on September 21, resulting in a release of approximately 9,200 barrels of oil and quantities of copper ore over the next 20 days.

On September 24, Clean Seas notified the U.S. Coast Guard's (USCG) Federal On Scene Coordinator (FOSC) that they would no longer be continuing operations due to disagreements over their contract with the owners.  The FOSC declared the incident a Federal response and opened the 311 (k) fund.  The USCG began negotiations to contract Clean Seas as part of the Federal response.  By September 28, Clean Seas had resumed working for the owners of the Pac Baroness, with the agreement that the owners would finance the Clean Seas response inclusive of the period from September 24 to September 28.

The vessel is headed for Baltimore from Houston with the cargo of Allyl Alcohol's ultimate  destination to be France.  SSC Gary Ott is on scene at MSO Hampton Roads.  The  initial evaluation by NOAA points out that although the material is poisonous,  flammability is the higher risk problem (flash point is 70 degrees Farhenheit), and further evaluations should be conducted with the measure of flammability as  a priority with the toxicity issue considered second in importance to that. The worst case scenario of a very large puddle of the material would have a IDLH  zone of 26 yards due to the low vapor pressure of Allyl Alcohol (17 mmHg at 20  degrees Celsius).  Allyl Alcohol is an intense irritant to the skin, eyes, nose  and throat, it causes burns on contact and is poisonous in small quantities. The lethal dose is approximately 1 ounce for a 150 lb. person. The material has good warning properties with extreme tearing of the eyes as an indicator. Other materials of a lower priority to be considered include P.Chlorobenzoyl Chloride of which there are 66 drums on the vessel.

PHONE (206) 526-6317. - _ - Per your request we have looked at trajectory implications of the urea that has been released from the barge Alaska.  These notes are based on the following information:-  - A barge located at 56? 28'N, 132? 23'W (Wrangell, Alaska) is reported to have cracks in the starboard and portside.  The vessel is carrying an unknown amount of urea stored as a bulk product.  At this time, the vessel is not leaking product.-  - If any of this initial information is incorrect, please let us know ASAP as it would affect any trajectory implications. - _ - 1) WEATHER - Today, the winds are forecast from the south at 30 knots with rain.  Tomorrow, the rain is expected to continue with winds from the south at 25 knots. -  - 2) GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF UREA - Urea is a white crystal or powder with very faint odor. It has a density of 1.3 (it would sink in water) and is soluble in water. Urea is commonly present in nature, in urine and other body fluid. As a fertilizer, urea contains 45-46% nitrogen, and is usually in the form of small pellets or granules. It is shipped in bags or in bulk.  -  - 3) TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS - The harbor is generally shallow and is rapidly flushed due to tidal action.  Any dissolved product will be quickly diluted by water exchange through the harbor entrance.  The dissolved urea will not affect the pH of the water much, the effect, if there is any, will be localized, and given the tidal current present any effect will quickly dissipated because of the flushing effect in the harbor. -  - 4)FATE AND EFFECT OF UREA - Solubility - Urea is very soluble in water.  In the case of a capsized vessel, the urea pellets will sink to the ocean floor while  dissolving in the water column. Water currents facilitate the dissolution process of urea in the same way that stirring a cup of coffee helps dissolve the sugar faster. Since the urea was stored in bulk, the granules may disperse as a \"cloud\" of fertilizer, each granule sinking independently while coming in full contact with the water. - Effect on pH - When urea dissolves in water it forms a weak base. The pH of the ocean water varies between 6.5 to 8.5. Usually it tends to be somewhat basic. In addition, the ocean has a substantial buffering capacity. In the past even large urea spills had minimal effect on the pH and we would expect the similar process during this incident. - Effect on the environment - We would not expect to see any algae bloom or other nutrient driven changes. The spilled urea dissolves quickly, eventually turning into carbon dioxide which escapes as gas and dissipates, and ammonia, which dilutes in the prevailing tidal current and quickly drops to ambient concentration. It is quite possible that the concentration of available nitrogen (in the form of ammonia) may be elevated for a short period of time at the immediate location of the spill. However, considering the rapid dilution and dispersion into the water column, exposure to organisms is predicted to be short-term. The biological literature focuses on phytoplankton effects and these seem to be mediated by light.  At this time of the year, the phytoplankton population is relatively small, and the amount of daylight minimal.  Adverse effects are expected to be minimal and confined to the harbor.

At the time of the fire, 70,000 gallons of #2 fuel oil in the double-bottom fuel tanks, one 3,000 pound tank of anhydrous ammonia, various cans of paint products, and eight 150-pound cylinders of chlorine were onboard.  An unknown amount of chlorine was released during the fire and 15 firefighters suffered respiratory distress and minor skin irritation.  The USCG MSO dispatched a USCG Fire Fighting Coordinator, HAZMAT team, and a 41-foot patrol boat to assist the Seattle Fire Department Incident Commander.\u000bThe fire started in the forward part of the processing area of the vessel when a welding spark fell on combustible material.  The fire spread to the lower deck and forward to the forecastle, causing extensive damage to the factory processing area.  Smoke from the fire necessitated closing the Ballard Bridge to traffic.  The main fire was extinguished at 1130, but the vessel contained hot spots and continued to have small flare ups through the night and into the next day.  Chlorine levels continued to be detected on the vessel and on the dock alongside, but, due to the threat of re-flash, the Seattle Fire Department suspended efforts to mitigate the potential chlorine release until November 10.  A USCG HAZMAT team member remained on-scene with the Seattle Fire Department overnight fire watch.  A unified command was set up among the USCG, State of Washington, vessel owner, and the Seattle Fire Department to address the continuing threat of a chlorine and/or ammonia release from the vessel.  The unified command met several times November 9 and 10 to review plans for site safety, the proposed repair and removal of the chlorine cylinders, ventilation of lower compartments, and vessel salvage.  \u000bThe chlorine threat was mitigated, the fire completely extinguished, and the vessel declared safe for entry by the morning of November 10.

The vessel was old and the oceanic crossing was scheduled to be her final journey.  After delivery of her cargo, the ship was destined for destruction as scrap.  Shortly following departure, a welded seam ruptured between two steel plates on the starboard side, well above the water line.  The U.S. harbor authorities refused permission to return to Los Angeles.  The vessel then proceeded to Ensenada Harbor in Baja California to have the ruptured seam repaired by welding.  Authorities in Ensenada refused permission to have the repair work done within the Harbor so welders were taken aboard and the ship proceeded offshore an estimated 60 miles to have the welding accomplished.  At this distance offshore, the vessel may have been situated within the influence of the southward-flowing California Current System. \u000b\u000bWelding repairs were completed successfully.  Unfortunately, a dense fog settled throughout the region.  A single sun sight was made within the two days offshore, to establish the ship's position.  On this basis, a return to Ensenada was undertaken to offload the welders.  In the early morning hours of March 29 1957, the vessel struck the coast at a location about 64 km south of Ensenada Harbor.  The bow grounded against one side of the entrance to a small cove on a predominantly rocky shore.  The stern apparently swung around and stuck on a shallow spot midway across the cove (henceforth Tampico cove) entrance.  The hull thus served as a breakwater across about 2/3 of the cove entrance, creating fairly calm conditions landward of the hull.

The rig was on fire and a slick extended from the rig to the western end of East Timbalier Island.  The slick contained mostly silver and rainbow sheen with a narrow band of dark colored streamers.  Burn residue was also observed in the slick.  Shoreline impacts on East Timbalier Island extended from the western tip and along the northern shore to the radio tower.  No impacts were observed east of the radio tower.  Two subsequent overflights mapped the shoreline features in greater detail since there had been more than a dozen breaks in the island due to Huricane Andrew.  Winds had increased to greater than 20 knots and a significant sea swell was forming, resulting in 5 -7 foot breakers on the Gulf side of the island.  Although visibility had diminished due to the lower sun angle, it appeared that the amount of oiling in the marshes had decreased significantly.  Only one small pocket of black pooled oil was observed in contrast to yesterday. The oil did not appear from the overflight to have undergone any significant emulsification.  A flight restricted zone with a radius of 5 miles and an altitude of 3000 feet was established around the rig at 1511 for all non- response aircraft.  The zone restriction will last for 6 hours.  The 36 inch boom that was deployed around the rig was destroyed in the fire.  The Coast Guard has deployed two more booms to the west of the rig.  The Coast Guard was unable to deploy the Open Water Containment and Recovery System (OWOCRS) because the water is too shallow.  USCG district 8.

The vessel was loaded with 91,984 barrels of lube oil and lube oil additives and 8,500 barrels of bunker fuel. Two crewmen and the pilot from the vessel were thrown into the water by the blast. The pilot and one crewman were recovered with serious burns.  One crewman remained missing and was presumed dead after an extensive search.  The explosion caused a relatively minor release of oil.  Flames from the initial and subsequent explosions shot as high as 1000 feet into the sky.  The fires on board the vessel were extinguished by late afternoon on November 1.\u000bFollowing the explosion, the USCG On-Scene Coordinator (OSC) ordered the vessel towed out of the vicinity of San Francisco Bay.  The intent of the order was to minimize the potential for catastrophic environmental effect from a massive release of oil.  On the basis of trajectory forecasts, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) recommended that the vessel be towed to the vicinity of a nearby ocean dumping site (37 32 N, 122 59 W).  This position is at the continental shelf break, 10 miles SE of the Farallon Islands.  The ongoing firefighting and cooling efforts were hampered as the vessel moved farther from shore. \u000bThe weather worsened on November 2, with seas as high as 16 feet and wind speeds up to 35 knots.  Salvage and inspection activities ceased for the day.  On November 3 at 0000, the Puerto Rican broke in two, releasing 25,000-35,000 barrels of its cargo and an undetermined amount of the 8,500 barrels of bunker fuel onboard.  The stern section sank one mile inside the boundary of the Point Reyes/Farallon Islands National Marine Sanctuary, taking most of the 8,500 barrels of bunker fuel with it.\u000bKeystone Shipping Co. of Philadelphia immediately assumed financial responsibility for the cleanup.
